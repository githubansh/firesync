## 📌 About the Project

FireSync revolutionizes remote entertainment by creating seamless watch party experiences across multiple platforms. In an era where staying connected with friends and family is more important than ever, FireSync bridges the gap between physical distance and shared experiences.

**The Problem:** Traditional streaming platforms lack synchronized viewing capabilities, making it difficult for people to watch content together remotely with real-time interaction.

**Our Solution:** A comprehensive cross-platform application that enables users to create private rooms, synchronize video playback in real-time, and engage through integrated chat systems across FireTV, mobile, and web platforms.
